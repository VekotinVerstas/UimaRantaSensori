# Swimming water temperature sensor

This project aims to implement a floating sensor buoy or can, which sends sensor data
via LoRaWAN IoT network to a web server and beyond.

## Planned sensors
 * water temperature (2 or 3 levels)
 * temperature, humidity and pressure (BME280) inside the can
 * luminosity
 * water conductivity
